# Midterm Project from Semester 2 in WebDev at SAIT ITSD
A three-part project consisting of a Currency Converter, A bakery site, and a travel page.

## `Currency Converter`
A simple page that uses JavaScript to convert input values. (Convertion values used are hardcoded and taken from date stated in the inline comment).

## `New City Bakeries`
With this part, we were tasked with creating a page that reads user input, calculates their total and prints them out at the bottom after submission.
Initially, the user is only able to enter their information as well as selceting a cake shape but further fields are displayed once they select a cake shape.

## `Travel Site`
In this single page HTML, we were tasked with testing out transitioning with images.

# How to Run
To run each project, use any IDE and run with a Live Server.
